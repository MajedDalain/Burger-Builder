Here I describe how I thought and what I did to build the app: 



1. Based on the design I decided to have the following Compoenents 
   
   Layout - SideDrawer - Navigation - Logo - NavigationItems - NavigationItem - Modal - Backdrop - Button - BurgerBuilder - BuildControls - BuildControl - OrderSummary - 


   Layout --> ToolBar - BurgerBuilder 
   
   Toolbar --> Logo - NavigationItems -    
   Layout --> 
   Burger --> BuildControls - Burgeringredients - OrderSummary - 
   logo --> 
   Navigatin --> navigationitems - sidedrawer- toolbar - 
   UI --> 

   think of containers and compoenents
