A project is done as a side project to enhance my own understanding of React framework. 



The following are the sources I read through my way to building the project: 

1. https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/interceptors 

2. https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper  ==> 
	I used the HOC in different places in the app, important to mention the use of hoc concept with the  	 
	global error hanlder, withErrorHandling component where by wrapping any other component inside 
	the error handler will guaranter rendering the error inside a model component, so the idea is that we have 
	the same logic for error handling inside one place, instead of writing the same logic for each different 
	component.
